#### Image Processing API

> In this project, I will create an API for image processing that will allow the user to visit a URL, and resize the image based on the parameters provided. When you view an image that has already been resized, a cached image will be served. This is the main functionality of placeholder image websites, and it can be combined with a frontend to serve sized images based on user input.
